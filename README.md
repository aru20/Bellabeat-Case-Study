# Bellabeat-Case-Study
## Introduction
The purpose of this case study is to analyze consumer data and provide insights to help guide a company’s marketing strategy.
Bellabeat is successful, small company that manufactures high-tech health products for women. 
The company’s CCO believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 
By analyzing user data, we were able to identify some trends in user sleep habits, inactivity and activity levels. 
This analysis will describe the trends as well as provide a high-level recommendation for marketing Bellabeat’s products.
## Phase 1: Ask
### 1. Identify the business task:

* Analyse smart devices usage data
* Provide high quality recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy
### Questions to guide analysis:

* What are some of the trends in smart device usage?
* How can you apply these trends to Bellabeat customers?
* How can these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
## 2. Consider key stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholder(s):
* Urska Srsen - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Bellabeat
* Sando Mur - Mathematician and co-founder of Bellabeat
### Secondary Stakeholder:
* Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team
Phases 2 & 3: Prepare & Process
1. Identify the data source:

Dataset: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available by Mobius). Click here to access the dataset –> link: This Kaggle dataset contains a personal fitness tracker from thirty FitBit users. Thirty eligible FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ behaviours and habits. These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between April 2016 to May 2016.

2. Determine the credibility of the data:

I will use the “ROCCC” system to determine the credibility and integrity of the data.

Reliability: This data is not reliable. There is no information about the margin of error and a small sample size (30 participants) has been used, which can limit the amount of analysis that can be done.

Originality: This is not an original dataset as it was originally collected from Amazon Mechanical Murk.

Comprehensiveness: This data is not comprehensive. There is no information about the participants, such as gender, age, health state, etc. This could mean that data was not randomised. If the data is biased, then the insights from the analysis will be unfair to all types of people.

Current: This data was collected in 2016, which means it is currently outdated and may not represent the current rends in smart device usage.

Cited: As stated before, Amazon Mechanical Murk created the dataset, but we have no information on whether this is a credible source.

The data integrity and credibility is clearly insufficient to provide reliable and comprehensive insights to Bellabeat. Therefore, the following analysis can only provide first hints and directions which should be verified through an analysis of a larger and much more reliable dataset.
