# Bellabeat-Case-Study
## Introduction
The purpose of this case study is to analyze consumer data and provide insights to help guide a company’s marketing strategy.
Bellabeat is successful, small company that manufactures high-tech health products for women. 
The company’s CCO believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 
By analyzing user data, we were able to identify some trends in user sleep habits, inactivity and activity levels. 
This analysis will describe the trends as well as provide a high-level recommendation for marketing Bellabeat’s products.
## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is available under a public domain license through Kaggle [1]. 
The dataset contains personal fitness tracker information collected from thirty Fitbit users.
Fitbit is a company that specializes in wearable fitness and health technology. 
The data includes users’ active minutes. According to Fitbit, active minutes are earned through ten or more minutes of continuous moderate to intense activity [2].
Additionally, the dataset contains information on users’ sleep duration. 
Since the data was generated from a survey of only thirty Fitbit users, its sample size is limited.
However, identifying trends within the Fitbit data can still be helpful in determining how to best market Bellabeat products since both companies have similar target consumers.
